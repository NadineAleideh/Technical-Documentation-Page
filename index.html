                    Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>What can Python do?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>Why Python?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other
                        programming languages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is
                        written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Good to know</h4>
                    <li>
                        The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.
                        However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is
                        still quite popular.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an
                        Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are
                        particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h4>
                    <li>
                        Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with
                        influence from mathematics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which
                        often use semicolons or parentheses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops,
                        functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

                <p>
                    A lot of people have asked me, ‘Which programming language is best for AI?’ or “Why Python for AI?”
                    Despite being a general purpose language, Python has made its way into the most complex technologies
                    such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>Why has Python gained so much popularity in all these fields?</h4>
                Here is a list of reasons why Python is the choice of language for every core Developer, Data Scientist,
                Machine Learning Engineer, etc:
                </p>

                        alt="python">
                </ul>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Less Code: </strong>Implementing AI involves tons and tons of algorithms. Thanks to
                        Pythons support for pre-defined packages, we don’t have to code algorithms. And to make things
                        easier, Python provides “check as you code” methodology that reduces the burden of testing the
                        code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prebuilt Libraries: </strong>Python has 100s of pre-built libraries to implement various
                        Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. So every time you want to run an algorithm on a
                        data set, all you have to do is install and load the necessary packages with a single command.
                        Examples of pre-built libraries include NumPy, Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ease of learning: </strong>Python uses a very simple syntax that can be used to
                        implement simple computations like, the addition of two strings to complex processes such as
                        building a Machine Learning model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Platform Independent: </strong>Python can run on multiple platforms including Windows,
                        MacOS, Linux, Unix, and so on. While transferring code from one platform to the other you can
                        make use of packages such as PyInstaller that will take care of any dependency issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Massive Community Support:</strong>Python has a huge community of users which is always
                        helpful when we encounter coding errors. Apart from a huge fan following, Python has multiple
                        communities, groups, and forums where programmers post their errors and help each other.
                    </li>

                <p>Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> print("Hello, World!")
                    Hello, World!
                </code>
              </pre>
                <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the
                    Command Line:
                </p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
                </code>
              </pre>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a
                value to it.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    x = 5
                    y = "John"
                    print(x)
                    print(y)
                </code>
              </pre>
            <p>
                Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have
                been set.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    x = 4       # x is of type int
                    x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
                    print(x)
                </code>
              </pre>
            <p>
                If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
                    y = int(3)    # y will be 3
                    z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

                    Built-in Data Type
                </h3>
                <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.

                    Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

                    Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

                    <h3>Creating a Function</h3>
                    In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
                </p>
                <code>def my_function():<br>
                    print("Hello from a function")
                </code><br><br>
                <p>
                    <h3>Calling a Function</h3>
                    To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
                </p>
                <code>def my_function():<br>
                    print("Hello from a function")
                  <br>
                  my_function()
                </code><br><br>
                <p>
                    <h3>Arguments</h3>
                    Information can be passed into functions as arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma. The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:
                </p>
                <code>def my_function(fname):<br>
                    print(fname + " Refsnes")
                  <br>
                  my_function("Emil")<br>
                  my_function("Tobias")<br>
                  my_function("Linus")
                </code><br><br>

                <p>
                    A <strong style="color: #ffcc3c;">for</strong> loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

                    This is less like the <strong style="color: #ffcc3c;">for</strong> keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
                    
                    With the <strong style="color: #ffcc3c;">for</strong> loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    Print each fruit in a fruit list:
                </p>
                <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
                    for x in fruits:<br>
                      print(x)
                </code><br><br>

                <p>
                    Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    Create and print a dictionary:
                </p>
                <code>thisdict = {<br>
                    "brand": "Ford",<br>
                    "model": "Mustang",<br>
                    "year": 1964<br>
                  }<br>
                  print(thisdict)
